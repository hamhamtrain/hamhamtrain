  <h1> mona // any pronouns </h1>

  <p> Hamha! I am mona, but I also go by other names as well.
    
  I'm a very quiet person and generally awkward w/ social interactions so will likely not talk much.
  I am very silly though once u get 2 know me!!
    
I'm ok w/ any interactions so long as they're purely platonic!! 
  If you happen to see me, feel free to drop by and say hi! however if i'm not respondin' i'm prolly afk/offtab/distracted, then whisps are ur best bet!

  I have a tendency to say mew so don't get too surprised if i start meowing like a cat lmao (im nromal i swear)
